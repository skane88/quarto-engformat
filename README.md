# Engineering Formats for Quarto

Contains a number of different engineering calculation formats for [Quarto](https://quarto.org), using the [Typst ](https://typst.app/) document compiler. See the individual extensions & Readmes for further information.

Any resemblence to the calculation formats of any current or previous employers are entirely incidental and not intended ðŸ¤£. Actually, these are templates that I have used "in production" for engineering calculations in my day-to-day work.

# Python

A python installation is required to run the example .qmd notebook, but otherwise may not be required. Your mileage may vary.
